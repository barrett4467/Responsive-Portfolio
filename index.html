                            Becca is a bit of a Newbie when it comes to code. Within the last couple of months she has taught herself some basic HTML and CSS skills and is currently enrolled in the University of Denverâ€™s Coding Bootcamp. Becca is from a small town in South-Eastern Colorado about 3 and a half hours southeast from Denver and is currently living in a tiny studio apartment in Arvada with her cat Allie. She is truly an artist at heart and loves to mess with Pastels and Acrylics in particular. You can also find her tending to her various houseplants, baking (she makes a mean cinnamon roll) or just spending time with her friends and family.

                            She enrolled in this Bootcamp because she loves to code. Everything so far has been an absolute blast and she looks forward to the rest of the curriculum.  A career in web development should provide an outlet for her creativity as well as provide a job with the flexibility to live anywhere and work from anywhere. Coding excites her and she cannot wait to work in web development.
